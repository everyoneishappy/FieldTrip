# FieldTrip
vvvv pack for working with 2D and 3D scalar and vector fields.

Some highlights:

•	modular node based raymarching 

•	lots of 2D & 3D SDFs (signed distance fields)

•	lots of useful noise functions

•	texture baker (handy if you want to for example use 3D noise in existing shaders)

•	some nice higher order tricks like being able to derive the gradient or curl of a function, Euler, RK2 & RK4 integration of a function

•	DX11.Particles adapter


Requires: 

  •vvvv >= 35.7 + Addon Pack
  
  •DX11 pack >= 1.1
